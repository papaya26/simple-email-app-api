## TECH STACK

### Express.js

I was informed that the current tech stack to be used is MEAN stack so I would like to show how I code using Express.js.

### MongoDB

The reason I've used MongoDB is because it's easy to use and to set up.

### Babel

The reason I've used Babel is I'm used to coding using latest javasript syntax, thus I use babel to convert it backwards.

## APIDOC

The erason I've used APIDOC (http://apidocjs.com/)for API documentation is it's pretty much straight forward and easy to use.

## Trade-off(s)/TODO(s)

Below are the trade-offs I've made due to time contraints:

- Would have been better if response handling is improved. For example, proper http status should be set to the response and every error response is with http status 500.
- Would have been better if proper user management API is done in relation to SEA.
- Would have been better if unit tests is created for each routes methods.
